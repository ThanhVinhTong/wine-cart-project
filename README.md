The three primary interrelated components of the system overview are the Web Server, Model Training, and Data Crawling. Each component is essential to developing the "Find Similar Wines" feature and showcasing the trained model's effectiveness.

- An essential part of the system is the "Data Crawling" phase, which involves gathering, analyzing, and cleaning data on wine from various sources. The major goal is to gather in-depth knowledge about wines while removing discrepancies and oddities. The meticulously selected data forms the backbone of the MongoDB database that runs the website and provides the input for ensuing Model Training. The technology guarantees a trustworthy and substantial dataset through the use of this methodical technique, opening the door for precise and insightful suggestions in the "Find Similar Wines" function.

- The processed data is split into testing, validation, and training sets throughout the model training step. For training and optimizing the image recognition model, these sets are essential. The model goes through several stages of training until it performs satisfactorily, often achieving approximately 99\% accuracy. When the model has achieved an appropriate level of generalization, it may be determined with the help of the validation set. The test set is used to gauge the model's overall efficacy after it operates within reasonable parameters. The final "Image Classification Model" is created if the model satisfies the necessary requirements. The Web Server then utilizes the trained model's skills through an API that was created utilizing the model to power the wine recommendation system.

- Wine Suggestion System and Search/Filter Products are the two primary functions of the web server. With the first, users may verify the correctness of the processed data that has been saved in MongoDB. However, in order to receive results in JSON format, the "Wine Suggestion System" communicates with the categorization model's API. It then does a search in MongoDB to present customers with their preferred wines. The outputs of these features are shown on the frontend, which enables people to access and view them using their browsers. Users may easily use and gain from the system's functions thanks to this simplified method.
